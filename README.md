Welcome to the repository for my BookDiaries Webpage, a dynamic online platform for book enthusiasts. This application is built with .NET 7, utilizing robust frameworks and libraries such as Identity for authentication, Entity Framework for ORM, and Dependency Injection for efficient service management.

### Key Features:
- **Secure User Authentication**: Integrated with ASP.NET Core Identity, ensuring secure user registration, login, and management.
- **Robust Data Management**: Leveraging Entity Framework to provide seamless data interaction and management.
- **Repository Pattern**: Implemented to abstract data access, making the code more maintainable and testable.
- **Email Services**: Configured with MailKit and MimeKit for reliable email sending capabilities.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrated with Stripe.NET for secure and efficient payment transactions.

### Why This Project?
This project is a showcase of my ability to design and implement a fully functional web application with .NET 7. The custom-designed logo and intuitive user interface aim to provide a seamless shopping experience for users. Employing advanced architectural patterns such as the Repository pattern highlights my commitment to high-quality, scalable software development.

Feel free to explore the code, and any contributions or feedback to improve the application are highly appreciated!
